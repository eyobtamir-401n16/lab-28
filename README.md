## About the lab

#### Users have an access to a form where a new ToDo task can be added and saved in the database. This form has the following fields:

  * Task Description / Text

    * Assigned To

    * Status (complete or incomplete)

    * Difficulty (a number between 1 and 5)

    * When users submit their new task form, they see their task appear in a list of current tasks. This list will allow you to select any task to toggle it from complete to incomplete or vice versa.
    
    * A user can delete task from the list.
